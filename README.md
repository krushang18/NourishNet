#NourishNet

we believe in the power of connection to reduce hunger and food waste. Our platform serves as a bridge between restaurants with excess food and NGOs dedicated to feeding communities.

Through our app, restaurants can easily inform NGOs about the type and quantity of surplus food they have available for donation.NGOs, in turn, can coordinate with restaurants to collect the food and distribute it to those in need, ensuring that every meal is utilized to its fullest potential.
